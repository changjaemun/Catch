### About this app
Hi, I am a university student in Korea who likes to take pictures

I’m currently a member of a university photography club. 
Just like when I was rookie photographer, new members of the club were having a hard time because they didn't know much about the basics of photography.
I thought it was hard to understand with just simple explanations and pictures. 
I made this app to make it easier and more fun for people who are beginner to cameras.

Everyone likes it (especially the developers, I don’t know why) and is friendly and often unexpected, so it was suitable to decide on the concept of the app for cats that are difficult to take pictures with.

 I named it Catch by mixing the word cat with the meaning of capturing the moment of taking a picture.
